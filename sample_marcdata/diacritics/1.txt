The file 1.mrc contains some MARC records we need for testing (thanks to Marcy and Stephen).   At the beginning are several test records that were specifically made to test special characters. Then there are a bunch of records in Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Hebrew, Arabic, Turkish, Polish, German & French.   And then there some records with odd punctuation in the title.   There are 60 bibs in total.
