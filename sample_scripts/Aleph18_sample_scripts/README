# XC OAI Toolkit Aleph 18 Sample Scripts

##################################################################################################################################

Scripts are included to perform the following from an Aleph 18 instance to the OAIToolkit:

          1. Full MARC Record Export from Aleph 18 and load into XC OAIToolkit
          2. Delta MARC Record Export from Aleph 18 and load into XC OAIToolkit
          3. Full Deleted MARC Record Export from Aleph 18 and load into XC OAIToolkit
          4. Delta Deleted MARC Record Export from Aleph 18 and load into XC OAIToolkit

In order to run correctly, some configuration is necessary. 
At the minimum the following needs to be done:

		  1. Install and run scripts on machine with Aleph install
          2. There must be a local Perl installation on the Aleph Server
          3. Perl Module MARC::Record must be installed on the Aleph Server (go to cpan.org to obtain)
          4. JVM version 6 or greater install where OAIToolkitImporter will run
          5. Ant version 1.7 or greater installed

OAIToolkit Importer Install and Configuration:

These scripts expect the latest copy of the OAIToolkit Importer to be installed on the Application server where the OAIToolkit Server is installed.
It also assumes that if they are not the same server, there is a mounted drive on the Aleph server that points to the application server
drive space where the OAIToolkitImporter is installed and lucene target directory if you will be using lucene.  The OAIToolkit Server
and OAIToolkitImporter should also be configured to point to the same MySQL instance.  Of course, alternative configurations are possible,
but it would require some modification of the scripts included.

Aleph Configuration:

You need to add an entry to tab_fix for your Aleph biblibrary that you will be loading from.  The fixroutine should call fix_doc_001.
These scripts expect the fixroutine name ADD01, but it can be called anything.  The script just needs to be updated to reference the
correct name.  This will add the system numbers to the 001 field for exported MARC records.

Scripts Configuration:

Before building the scripts you will want update various paths in the csh scripts to mirror your environment, especially the runtime/install
location of the scripts needs to be correct.  You will also want to update the biblibrary mentioned in the aleph_export_full_oai_toolkit.csh
and aleph_export_deltas_to_oai_toolkit.csh scripts.  You also need to make the location of the OAIToolkitImporter and lucene target directory
paths are correct.  

!!!*************************************************************************************************************!!!

You must make sure XC_HOME environment variable is set in the user's environment that will execute the scripts

!!!*************************************************************************************************************!!!

Also, at a minimum you should check and update the following environment variables in environment.csh:

		biblibrary1      	You should change this to the appropriate bib library
        
		fix_routine_add_sys_no_to_01			The name of the fixroutine created above to put the system number into 001.
		
		xc_oai_toolkit_importer_dir				OAIToolkit Importer install location
		java_bin_dir							Java 6 bin directory
		oai_toolkit_importer_data_dir			Data Directory for running the OAIToolkit Importer 
												(lucene files will be placed in $oai_toolkit_importer_data_dir/lucene)

Build and Deploy:

	Run ant dist to build the zip file for the OAIToolkit Importer shell scripts
	scp the tar ball created in the dist directory to your Aleph server

	Extract the contents to a temporary directory and run the following to deploy the files to the correct location.

	chmod + deploy.pl
	deploy.pl [destination_dir] [deploy_person_initials]

	ex: deploy.pl /home/aleph18/xc rpj

The deploy script will automatically copy all files to the destination directory while maintaining
the folder hierarchy in the tarball.  Before overwriting any files, it will create a copy of pre-existing files in an archive
directory.  When creating the archive copy it will add the initials supplied and date/timestamp of the archive.

Execution Full load:

csh -f [install_location]/bin/aleph_export_full_oai_toolkit.csh

The delta load is split into two parts as deleted items need to be loaded separately.
They would most likely be run daily following one or infrequent full load....

Execution Delta Load (Add/Modify):

csh -f [install_location]/bin/aleph_export_deltas_to_oai_toolkit.csh

Execution Delta Load (Delete):

csh -f [install_location]/bin/aleph_export_deleted_deltas_to_oai_toolkit.csh

There is also a script to load all deleted items from Aleph.  This will probably only
be used if data on the XC side cannot be completely refreshed and many deleted items are missed.
Normally, the full load script would be run once and then the two delta scripts would be
cronned to run daily.

Execution Load All Deleted Items:

csh -f [install_location]/bin/aleph_export_deleted_full_oai_toolkit.csh
