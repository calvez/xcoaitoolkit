Scripts are included to perform either a full load or delta load from an Aleph instance to the OAIToolkit.  In order to run correctly,
some configuration is necessary (steps to follow).

Note: This currently does not cover deleted records.  Support will be added soon.

At the minimum the following needs to be done:

		  1. Install and run scripts on machine with Aleph install
          2. There must be a local Perl installation on the Aleph Server
          3. Perl Module MARC::Record must be installed on the Aleph Server (go to cpan.org to obtain)
          4. JVM version 6 or greater install where OAIToolkitImporter will run

OAIToolkit Importer Install and Configuration:

These scripts expect the latest copy of the OAIToolkit Importer to be installed on the Application server where the OAIToolkit Server is installed.
It also assumes that if they are not the same server, there is a mounted drive on the Aleph server that points to the application server
drive space where the OAIToolkitImporter is installed and lucene target directory if you will be using lucene.  The OAIToolkit Server
and OAIToolkitImporter should also be configured to point to the same MySQL instance.  Of course, alternative configurations are possible,
but it would require some modification of the scripts included.

Aleph Configuration:

You need to add an entry to tab_fix for your Aleph biblibrary that you will be loading from.  The fixroutine should call fix_doc_001.
These scripts expect the fixroutine name ADD01, but it can be called anything.  The script just needs to be updated to reference the
correct name.  This will add the system numbers to the 001 field for exported MARC records.

Scripts Configuration:

Before building the scripts you will want update various paths in the csh scripts to mirror your environment, especially the runtime/install
location of the scripts needs to be correct.  You will also want to update the biblibrary mentioned in the aleph_export_full_oai_toolkit.csh
and aleph_export_deltas_to_oai_toolkit.csh scripts.  You also need to make the location of the OAIToolkitImporter and lucene target directory
paths are correct.  At a minimum you should check and update the following environment variables in each script:

	aleph_export_full_oai_toolkit.csh & aleph_export_deltas_to_oaitoolkit.csh:
	
		xc_bin_dir			The deployment location of all of the csh and perl scripts included
		biblibrary1      	You should change this to the appropriate bib library
        
	aleph_export_to_oai_toolkit.csh:
	
		fix_routine_add_sys_no_to_01			The name of the fixroutine created above to put the system number into 001.
		xc_home									Should be set to the root of the install location of these scripts on the aleph server
		
	aleph_call_java_oai_toolkit_importer.csh:
	
		xc_oai_toolkit_importer_dir				OAIToolkit Importer install location
		java_bin_dir							Java 6 bin directory
		oai_toolkit_importer_data_dir			Data Directory for running the OAIToolkit Importer 
												(lucene files will be placed in $oai_toolkit_importer_data_dir/lucene)		

Build and Deploy:

	Run ant dist to build the tar ball for the OAIToolkit Importer shell scripts
	scp the tar ball created in the dist directory to your Aleph server

	Extract the contents to a temporary directory and run the following to deploy the files to the correct location.

	chmod + deploy.pl
	deploy.pl [destination_dir] [deploy_person_initials]

	ex: deploy.pl /home/aleph18/xc rpj

The deploy script will automatically copy all files to the destination directory while maintaining
the folder hierarchy in the tarball.  Before overwriting any files, it will create a copy of pre-existing files in an archive
directory.  When creating the archive copy it will add the initials supplied and date/timestamp of the archive.

Execution Full load:

csh -f [install_location]/bin/aleph_export_full_oai_toolkit.csh

Execution Delta Load:

csh -f [install_location]/bin/aleph_export_deltas_to_oai_toolkit.csh
