PREREQUISITES
   - Note that this script has only been tested using III 2007 1.2.
      * I have no way of knowing whether it will work on other versions
   - Telnet access to the Innovative Interfaces (non-Oracle) catalog
   - A server - preferably Unix/Linux - on which the OAI Toolkit has been
      installed
   - The server needs to have the following features
      * Expect
      * Perl
      * Perl::Expect
      * FTP Server open to the III Millenium server's IP address
   - The III server must 
      * Provide for telnet access from the OAI Toolkit box and have the
         address listed in the FTS server list
      * It must either be open to a direct connect from that address or
         have an authorized account with which to log into the server.
         The scripts as written support the former option

CONFIGURATION
A number of parameters need to be set in the xc_get_marc.pl file:
   $server - name/IP address of III Telnet interface
   $filenum - work area for bib output
   $sc_filenum - workarea for created/suppressed records.
   $sm_filenum - workarea for modified/suppressed records.  Note that the
                  values for both of these last two can be the same as 
                  $filenum once you are secure that things are being
                  transferred properly
   $testing - whether you are working on a subset of the full bib database
                  for testing purposes
   @my_test_range  - this is the range of bibnumbers within which you wish 
   @my_test_range2    to do the testing.

Email parameters (not yet implemented)
   $to - email address of person to whom to send the results of the script run
   $from - XC user account that runs the script
   $cc - other email address to which results should be sent

Values used in the script
   @exp_user - username for account on XC box to which files will be sent
   @exp_pass - @exp_user's password
   $filename - name for bibfile to be sent to XC box
   $sc_filename - name of suppressed created records
   $sm_filename - name of suppressed modified records
   $init - Initials and password needed to get into the List creation
   $ipass   and FTS subsystems of III
   $suppreeddate - earliest date to check for suppression in the suppressed
                    records search

Other values that may need to be changed
   As noted in the third paragraph of the header to the xc_get_marc.pl script,
    Expect literally "expects" certain values to be sent to it before it will
    proceed to the next step.  If any of the menus have a different set of
    letters in any of the menus selection strings (e.g. "E,R,X,U,Q") than
    what is included here, you will need to modify the script to look for
    the string that your system provides as a prompt.

IMPLEMENTATION
   Once the scripts have been installed you have verified that the data is
    transferred properly, you will need to do the following:
      1) Set up a cron process to run every day (we are doing it just after
          midnight) to transfer the files to the XC server
      2) Once on the XC server, there should be a cron job that moves the files
          to the OAIToolkit/marc directory, changing the suffix to .mrc and 
          changing the ownership of the files to that under which OAIToolkit
          runs
      3) Run the OAIToolkit loading routine
